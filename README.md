# Data-Dome-Unity-Toolkit

A toolkit for achieving dome master format in a Unity build. It is tweaked and tested for the At-Bristol Planetarium screen in Bristol, UK but should work for any dome capable of running Unity. 

**Update Oct 2016**

To avoid a bug the plugin needs to be opened with project setting, therefore you need to open as a project in Unity rather than using it as an asset package.

Previous version as an asset pack is still in Old folder
